The prototypical examples have trivial blocks, for example Taylor() and Chebyshev() have blocks of length 1, as each coefficient corresponds to a higher polynomial degree.\n\nUsually, non-trivial block lengths arise from modifications of the spaces with trivial blocks.  For example, Chebyshev(0..1) ∪ Chebyshev(2..3) has blocks of length 2, as the blocks of each component space are grouped together to form a single block.  Another important example is Chebyshev() ⊗ Chebyshev(), the tensor product space.  There are d polynomials of degree d, thus the blocks of a tensor product space grow: that is, the first block has length 1, then 2, and so on.\n\nblocklengths(::Space) gives an iterator that encodes the lengths of the blocks.
