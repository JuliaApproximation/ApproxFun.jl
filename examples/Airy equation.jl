#The following solves the Airy ODE with dirichlet boundary conditions

x=Fun(identity,[-1000.,15.])   # Fun corresponding to multiplication by x, on [-100,15]
d=domain(x)
D=Derivative()             # The derivative operator
B=dirichlet()              # Dirichlet boundary conditions, [u(-100),u(15)]

#Construct operator

A=[B;D^2-x]                # This is dirichlet conditions and u'' - x u
b=[airyai(first(d)),0.]         # We want it to equal airyai(-100) at -100, and 0 at
                           # 10, with 0 rhs
#Solve ODE

u=A\b                      # u satisfies A*u = b, or in other words,
                           # B*u = [airyai(-100.),0.] and (D2 - x)*u = 0.

# Check the accuracy
norm(u - Fun(airyai,d))


## We now solve with Neumann conditions

B=neumann()
A=[B;D^2-x]
b=[airyaiprime(first(d)),0.,0.]

u=A\b


# Check the accuracy
norm(u - Fun(airyai,d))
